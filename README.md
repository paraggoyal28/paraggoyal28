## 2026 Resolutions
Becoming a T shaped developer

**1. Identify and Anchor Your "Vertical" (Depth)**

* The Goal: Master one domain (e.g., React, Go, Security, or Site Reliability) so deeply that you can solve the toughest problems and mentor others. (TODO: pick one area)
* *Google's Tip*: Deep expertise builds authority and credibility within the organization.

**2. Cultivate Your "Horizontal" (Breadth)**

* The Goal: Understand the "why" behind requests and how different components (APIs, CI/CD, UX, or Infrastructure) work together.
* *Google's Tip*: Breadth protects you from tunnel vision. It helps you choose the right layer to solve a problem—for example, knowing when to solve a performance issue via caching (infrastructure) rather than refactoring code (logic).

**3. Master "Influence Without Authority"**

* Google emphasizes that senior T-shaped engineers must lead initiatives even when they aren't the manager.
* The Goal: Use your broad knowledge to bridge gaps between teams (e.g., explaining technical trade-offs to Product Managers or UX designers).
* *Google's Tip*: The fastest way to earn influence is through empathy for other roles' goals and using data/prototypes to back up your suggestions.

**4. Practice "Strategic Communication"**

* A key point in the Google guide is the shift from what you are building to how it aligns with the business.
* Manage Up: Proactively share blockers and link your daily tasks to team-level priorities.
* *Ask Better Questions*: Instead of just taking a ticket, ask questions to uncover the "why" and explore technical trade-offs early.

**5. Manage Your Focus**

* *The Goal*: Avoid the trap of "17 open browser tabs." Use your T-shaped knowledge to filter out noise and focus on high-impact architectural challenges.
